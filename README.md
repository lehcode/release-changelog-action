# Development

## Install the dependencies

```bash
$ yarn install
```

## Run tests

```
$ yarn test
```

## Build and package it for distribution

```
$ yarn build && yarn package
```

## Publish action to a distribution

Actions are run from GitHub repos so we will checkin the packed dist folder.

Then run [ncc](https://github.com/zeit/ncc) and push the results:

```bash
$ npm run package
$ git add dist
$ git commit -a -m "chore: prod dependencies"
```

After testing you can [create a v1 tag](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md) to reference the stable and latest V1 action
